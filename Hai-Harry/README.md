**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

We wanted to create and stylize a blog app that implements the "mobile-first" design paradigm that we have been learning in class. We set up the viewport and fluid media rules to allow content to render on both mobile and desktop platforms, using a breakpoint of 640 pixels. To do this, our team tried to use standard industry practices for organization and flow of our work, avoiding frivolous/unnecessary code. However, we only wanted to use HTML and CSS, forgoing JavaScript and jQuery. We want our app to be user friendly and allow said users to update the blogs content whenever they would like. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Users would need to be able to run live server from the root directory.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Our team utilized HTML and CSS for our app design. More specifically, we took our modularized css file and spread its contents to the appropriate base, layout, and modules css files. We also needed a media query section in our css to better display on different devices. 

## Change Log
